Does the UE5 Nvidia branch actually work on Linux?





So I built it easily by cloning the repo.






./Setup.sh




./GenerateProjectFiles.sh





make





Some parts of it build, about 100 things failed to built.





Than I converted my project to supprot the Nvidia branch.





./Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/Build.sh FPSTestEditor Linux Development \
  -Project="/mnt/nvme/home/ram/Documents/Code/Unreal Engine/FPSTest-RTX/FPSTest.uproject" \
  -TargetType=Editor -Progress






And than every time I build my project a failure.




The one time I got the project to build was by using the built tools from the UE5 binary provided by Epic Games.
